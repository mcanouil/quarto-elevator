title: Elevator.js Quarto Extension
format: html
---

This extension allows you to use [Elevator.js](https://github.com/tholman/elevator.js) in your Quarto HTML documents.
It provides an `{{{< elevator >}}}` shortcode:

- Mandatory:
  ``` markdown
  {{{< elevator >}}}
  ```

- Optional `<text-button>`, `<anchor-target>`, and `<audio=audio.mp3>`:
  ``` markdown
  {{{< elevator <text-button> <anchor-target> <audio=audio.mp3> >}}}
  ```

:::{style='text-align: center;'}

```{=html}
<style>
.down-arrow {
  font-size: 120px;
  margin-top: 120px;
  margin-bottom: 120px;
  text-shadow: 0px -20px #0C1F31, 0px 0px #C33329;
  color: rgba(0,0,0,0);
  -webkit-transform: scaleY(0.8);
  -moz-transform: scaleY(0.8);
  transform: scaleY(0.8);
}
</style>
```

Elevator.js fixes those awkward "scroll to top" moments the old fashioned way.

<div class="down-arrow">&#9660;</div>
First we need to get to the bottom of the page.
<div class="down-arrow">&#9660;</div>
Because you're already at the top.
<div class="down-arrow">&#9660;</div>
So a "back to top" button wouldn't make sense.
<div class="down-arrow">&#9660;</div>
Down down down.
<div class="down-arrow">&#9660;</div>
## Wow, all this scrolling
<div class="down-arrow">&#9660;</div>
This had better be worth it.
<div class="down-arrow">&#9660;</div>
It's going to take ages to get back to the top.
<div class="down-arrow">&#9660;</div>
If only we had an easy way to get back...
<div class="down-arrow">&#9660;</div>
...that is both functional and fun.
<div class="down-arrow">&#9660;</div>
I call "back to top" buttons elevators...
<div class="down-arrow">&#9660;</div>
...they should really behave more like them.
<div class="down-arrow">&#9660;</div>
Ok, here we are... click that elevator!

{{< elevator audio=_extensions/elevator/BossaBossa.mp3 >}}

Or `{{{< elevator "Return to 'Wow, all this scrolling.'" wow-all-this-scrolling audio=_extensions/elevator/BossaBossa.mp3 >}}}` to scroll up to `## Wow, all this scrolling`.
